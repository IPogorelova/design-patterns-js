**Flyweight** - a space optimization technique that lets us use less memory by storing externally the data associated with similar objects.

Summary:
1. Store repeating common data externally.
2. Specify index/reference into the external data store. 
3. Define the idea of "ranges" on homogeneous collections and store data related to those ranges.
