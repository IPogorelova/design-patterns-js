**Decorator** - a component that facilitates the addition of behaviour to individual objects without inheriting from them.

Summary:
1. A decorator keeps the reference to the decorated objects
2. Adds utility fields and methods to augment the object's features. 
3. May or may not forward calls to the underlying object.
