**Facade** - provides a simple, easy to understand user interface over a large and sophisticated body of code.

Summary:
1. Build a Facade to provide a simple API over a set of classes.
2. May wish to (optionally) expose internals through the Facade (possibility to use low level classes). 
3. May allow users to "escalate" to use more complex APIs if they need to.
