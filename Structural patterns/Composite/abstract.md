**Composite** - a mechanism for treating individual (scalar) objects and compositions of objects in a uniform manner.

Summary:
1. Objects can use other objects via interface/composition.
2. Some composed and singular objects need similar/identical behaviour.
3. Composite design pattern lets us treat both types of objects uniformly.
4. JS supports iteration with `Symbol.iterator`
5. A single object can make itself iterable by yielding `this`.
