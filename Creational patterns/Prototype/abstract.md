**Prototype** - a partially or fully initialized object that you copy (clone) and make use of.

Summary of the course piece:
1. Implement a prototype => partially construct an object => store it somewhere.
2. Deep copy the prototype.
3. Customize the resulting instance (e.g. change the name field)
4. A factory provides a convenient API for using prototypes => prototype factory is a good idea.
